This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Wavecon Telecom's key performance metrics before and after the 5G launch in May 2022. The focus is on evaluating the impact of the 5G rollout on revenue, the performance of various plans, and critical KPIs across 15 major urban centers in India.

## Key Questions Answered

### 1. What is the impact of the 5G launch on our revenue?
- **Revenue Impact**:

  - **After the 5G Launch**: Revenue slightly decreased to ₹15.89 billion.
  - **Net Loss**: This represents a loss of ₹8.04 crores.

- **Top Performing Plans**:
  - **Super Saviour Pack (P2)**: 
    - **Description**: 1.5 GB/day combo for 56 days.
    - **Reason for Performance**: This plan continues to be popular due to its balance of data offering and price, making it an attractive option for users.
  - **Elite Saver Pack (P3)**:
    - **Description**: 1 GB/day, valid for 28 days.
    - **Reason for Performance**: This plan's shorter validity appeals to customers who prefer monthly cycles, ensuring its strong performance post-5G launch.
- **Underperforming Plans**:
  - **Big Combo Pack (P10)**:
    - **Description**: 6 GB/day, valid for 3 days.
    - **Reason for Underperformance**: The high daily data limit and short validity period may not align with customer needs in a 5G environment where longer-term data usage patterns are emerging.
  - **Daily Saviour Pack (P8)**:
    - **Description**: 1 GB/day, valid for 1 day.
    - **Reason for Underperformance**: The very short validity of this plan seems less relevant in the 5G era, where users are likely looking for more extended data usage options.
  - **Combo Topup Pack (P9)**:
    - **Description**: 14.95 talktime and 300 MB data.
    - **Reason for Underperformance**: The limited data offering makes this plan less attractive in a market increasingly focused on data consumption rather than talktime.

### 4. Is there any plan affected largely by the 5G launch? Should we continue or discontinue that plan?
- **Plans Largely Affected**:

  - **Big Combo Pack (P10)**:
    - **Impact**: This plan saw a significant decline in performance, likely due to its mismatch with the evolving data consumption patterns of 5G users.
    - **Recommendation**: **Discontinue** this plan, as it does not meet the needs of the current customer base and has seen a sharp drop in revenue generation.
  - **Daily Saviour Pack (P8)** and **Combo Topup Pack (P9)**:
    - **Impact**: Both plans have underperformed in the 5G market.
    - **Recommendation**: Consider **discontinuation** or **modification** to better align with user expectations in the 5G context.

### 5. Is there any plan that is discontinued after the 5G launch? What is the reason for it?
- **Discontinued Plans**:

  - **Big Combo Pack (P10)**:
    - **Pre-5G Performance**: Generated ₹13.11 crores.
    - **Reason for Discontinuation**: Became outdated due to the new 5G service offerings, with customers shifting to more competitive options.
  - **Daily Saviour Pack (P8)**:
    - **Pre-5G Performance**: Generated ₹43.43 crores.
    - **Reason for Discontinuation**: Low compatibility with 5G services and customer preference for more extensive data plans.
  - **Combo Topup Pack (P9)**:
    - **Pre-5G Performance**: Generated ₹22.68 crores.
    - **Reason for Discontinuation**: Customers migrated to better-suited 5G plans, rendering this pack obsolete.



## Conclusion
The 5G launch at Wavecon Telecom presents both challenges and opportunities. While some plans have thrived, others have struggled, leading to a necessary reevaluation of the product lineup. Strategic adjustments, such as discontinuing underperforming plans and focusing on customer retention and experience, are crucial for recovering lost revenue and capitalizing on the 5G market potential.
